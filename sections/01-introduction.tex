\section{Introduction}

This document captures proposed enhancements to the SIA Open Supervised Device Protocol (OSDP) needed to carry FICAM-compliant Personal Identity Verification (PIV) workflows. The material consolidates draft content, reviewer comments, and interoperability feedback collected during the 2025 working sessions and re-expresses it as normative guidance for command authors and device implementers.

The chapters that follow highlight changes required for existing OSDP~2.2 commands, introduce new transactions where no equivalent existed, and provide supplemental examples that reflect current federal credentialing practices. Wherever the proposal diverges from the baseline specification, the text records both the behavioral requirements and the error handling expectations so that access control units (ACUs) and peripheral devices (PDs) can adopt the profile without relying on vendor extensions.
